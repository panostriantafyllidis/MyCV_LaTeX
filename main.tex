        \item Deployed Telegraf across 12 \textbf{Amazon EC2} instances, a move which unveiled and subsequently led to rectifying several performance bottlenecks.
        \item Modernized the logging approach by transitioning to \textbf{ClickHouse}, thereby ending the thread-related challenges of the erstwhile file-based system.
        \item Teamed up with fellow developers to incorporate \textbf{DataDog} APM into \textbf{Java} applications, shedding light on intricate application operations and pinpointing areas of enhancement.
    \end{itemize}

        \item Incorporated \textbf{XML parsing} techniques for data extraction from Microsoft Word documents.
        \item Employed \textbf{Optical Character Recognition with OpenCV} to interpret non-editable PDFs.
        \item Applied \textbf{Natural Language Processing using NLTK} to categorize text tokens such as names, addresses, and skills.
        \item Navigated database interactions using \textbf{PyAutoGUI}, a workaround due to limited direct database access.
